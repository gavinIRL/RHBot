# RHBot
## Summary
Simple bot to automate combat, selling gear at end of level, and other basic functions. The title of the game this bot is used for will remain hidden until further in the development cycle to reduce the likelihood of a ban. The game in question is an old (>10years since launch) game that is an online multiplayer game on PC.

## Motivation
Alongside the DCW application (specifically the bot playground and creation aspect of DCW), I have an interest in assessing the automation of certain tasks. More specifically I have an interest in the efficiency of automating tasks in comparison to manually doing them. This bot application is intended as a learning experience for useful automation with a reasonably complex set of situations. The approaches to be taken include bot image recognition (probably using OpenCV or similar) and also the standard fixed-sequence movement patterns (using PyAutoGUI and/or PyDirectInput).

## Planned Features - (Single level only at beginning)
1) Automated movement to next area
2) Automated basic combat, enemy detection, and target prioritising
3) Automated loot pickup
4) Automated selling of loot
5) Automated special event handling (bonus areas, etc.)
6) Multiple levels/zones
7) More advanced combat e.g. impending enemy attack detection, automated blocking

Note: Will finish this section later.
